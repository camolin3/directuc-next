directUC-next
=============

The idea of this project is to be the succesor of **directUC** for `Chrome` and `Firefox`: one codebase to rule them all.

This codebase should be:

 - Not tied to any specific browser (tomorrow `Safari` could join the party)
 - Using tests from the beggining to assure quality
